## Solution

This one was pretty straightforward. You can find the play of interest by looking at strings and finding what looks like a C2 URL. Going to the place the URL is referenced and then looking at the surrounding XRefs and functions, eventually you will notice an interesting set of code that copies some data and then XORs it:

![eepy_2.png](/images/eepy_2.png)

We can do the same thing:
```
emit eepy.exe |r.vsnip 0x140003020:0x26 | r.xor 0xAA
```
