## Solution

This challenge has a few layers of obfuscated PowerShell, ultimately the last later writes the flag to an environment variable for that process.

The simplest way to get the flag is to use `PowerShell ISE` and step into each `IEX` call until that last one, at which point you can change the `IEX` to a call to `Write-Output` instead, which will yield the flag.
