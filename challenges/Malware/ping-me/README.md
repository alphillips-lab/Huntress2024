## Solution

This is a VBA deobfuscation challenge. It can be easily overcome by switching the `Execute` keyword to `WScript.Echo`, and then running it using `cscript.exe`. The output is a command that pings a list of "ip" addresses.

Upon closer inspection, we can see that the IP addresses may actually be the decimal representation of the flag.

```
ips = ["102.108.97.103", "123.54.100.49", "98.54.48.52", "98.98.49.98", "54.100.97.51", "50.98.56.98", "98.99.97.57", "101.50.54.100", "53.49.53.56", "57.125.35.35"]
```

With refinery:
```
emit |r.repl "\"" "" |r.repl " " "" |r.repl "." "," |r.carve intarray |r.pack
```
