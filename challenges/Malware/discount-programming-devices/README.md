## Solution

I think the intended solution is to decode this one, but it actually just prints out the flag if you run it :D

To decode this, you can simply loop through the input until you find the flag.

A simple script like the following would work:
```python
import refinery.shell as r
import sys

data = r.ef(sys.argv[1]) | ... 

while True:
    data = data | r.rev() | r.carve("b64", "-l", "-t", "1") | r.b64() | r.zl() | ...
    if b"decode" in data:
        data = data | r.carve("b64", "-l", "-t", "1") | r.b64() | r.zl() | ...
        break

print(data.decode())
```
